## Last Closed Phase

### Phase 6M — Producer Realism / Timer Producer Diagnostic

- **Commit:** `a6b253b` (Phase 6M implementation)
- **Closed by:** Phase 6Z RTT evidence (joint closeout for 6K/6L/6M)
- **Date:** 2026-05-07
- **Branch:** master
- **Remote:** `https://github.com/thangnguyeniot-afk/Robot_OS` (confirmed linked)

Phase 6K (`11516d4`) and Phase 6L (`d3759a7`) were closed jointly with
Phase 6M under the same Phase 6Z RTT capture session.

## Validation Evidence (Phase 6Z RTT closeout for Phase 6K / 6L / 6M)

| Gate | Result | Detail |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Host tests | PASS | 20/20 suites (Phase 6M added timer-producer contract suite, 59 cases); 0 failures (per commit `a6b253b`) |
| Zephyr build | PASS | `west build -b stm32f411e_disco RobotOS_v1.0/devkit/ --pristine` (Phase 6Z session) |
| FLASH | 30032 B / 524288 B (5.73%) | stm32f411e_disco (matches Phase 6M baseline) |
| RAM | 12160 B / 131072 B (9.28%) | stm32f411e_disco (unchanged from Phase 6J/6K/6L/6M) |
| Flash | PASS | `west flash` wrote 32768 B from `zephyr.hex` in 1.123 s (ST-LINK V2J47S0) |
| RTT capture | PASS | OpenOCD streaming RTT TCP server, 60 s wallclock, 16,560 bytes captured |
| CFSR | 0x00000000 throughout | All 13 ROBOTOS_FAULT emissions over 60 s |
| HFSR | 0x00000000 throughout | All 13 ROBOTOS_FAULT emissions over 60 s |
| Manual physical RESET | not required | OpenOCD `reset run` started firmware cleanly post-flash |

RTT log: `RobotOS_v1.0/devkit/logs/phase_6Z_rtt_2026-05-07.txt`

**Phase 6Z verification highlights:**

- Phase 6K: ROBOTOS_OBS baseline + 12 periodic emissions; `peak=16` reached during Phase 6I burst, then steady-state `pending=1` after ticks=40.
- Phase 6L: ROBOTOS_FAULT baseline + 12 periodic emissions; CFSR/HFSR zero throughout; `active=0`, `context=none` invariant.
- Phase 6M: ROBOTOS_PROD baseline + 12 periodic emissions; producer init banner present; `attempted` grew exactly +5 per 10 ticks (60 attempts total over 60 s); `ok=attempted`, `dropped=0` for the entire capture.
- Phase 6I final summary: `attempted=24 ok=17 full=7 handled=16` (one-event timing variance vs documented `ok=16 full=8`; architectural invariants preserved — see Phase 6Z section in `DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md`).
- Counter cross-check at ticks=120: Phase 6I `ok` (17) + Phase 6M `ok` (60) = `accepted` (77); Phase 6I handled (16) + Phase 6M handled (60) = `dispatched` (76); `accepted - dispatched = pending = 1`.

## Behavior Guarantees Through Phase 6Z

Phase 6Z is evidence/state-reconciliation only and changed no source.
The following invariants from Phase 6J carry forward unchanged through
Phase 6K / 6L / 6M and are confirmed by the Phase 6Z RTT capture:

- **No new status codes.** `ROBOTOS_CORE_ERR_THROTTLED = -7` remains the highest-numbered error.
- **No scheduler semantics changed.** `ROBOTOS_CORE_MAX_EVENTS_PER_TICK = 1` unchanged.
- **No auto-retry behavior.** Retry policy remains pure advisory stateless mapping.
- **No dispatch lock-boundary regression.** Handler-outside-lock invariant confirmed preserved.
- **No admission policy change.** NONE/reserved rejected; USER+ accepted: unchanged.
- **`peak_queue_depth` is passive.** Updated only after successful push, under existing lock. Monotonically non-decreasing. Not reset by repeated init. Zero behavioral impact. Phase 6Z RTT confirmed `peak=16 = ROBOTOS_EVENT_QUEUE_CAPACITY` reached during the Phase 6I burst.
- Existing `post_event` / `try_post_event` semantics unchanged.
- **Phase 6K/6L/6M observability surfaces are passive.** ROBOTOS_OBS, ROBOTOS_FAULT, and ROBOTOS_PROD logs do not feed into scheduling, admission, throttle, dispatch, or retry decisions. Verified by Phase 6Z behavior coherence check.
- **Phase 6M producer cadence is fixed at compile time.** 1 post / 2 ticks at `DEVKIT_TICK_MS=500`; producer never reads core counters. Verified by Phase 6Z `attempted` growth of exactly +5 per 10 ticks.

## Files Changed in Phase 6Z

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `RobotOS_v1.0/devkit/logs/phase_6Z_rtt_2026-05-07.txt` | New -- raw RTT capture, 60 s, 16,560 bytes |
| `RobotOS_v1.0/devkit/docs/DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md` | Phase 6K/6L/6M close-status flips; Phase 6Z section appended |
| `CURRENT_STATE.md` | Last-closed phase advanced to Phase 6M (closed via Phase 6Z) |

No source code, tests, CMake, Kconfig, prj.conf, or runtime behavior
modified in Phase 6Z. See `DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md` Phase 6Z Architecture
Preservation Audit for the explicit list.

## Phase History Summary (completed, confirmed from DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md)

The following phases are closed and committed. This list is not exhaustive — refer
to `DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md` for the full history.

| Phase | Description | Commit |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| 6Z | RTT closeout for 6K/6L/6M (docs/evidence only) | (this commit) |
| 6M | Producer Realism / Timer Producer Diagnostic | `a6b253b` |
| 6L | Fault Observability Integration | `d3759a7` |
| 6K | Runtime Observability Surfacing | `11516d4` |
| 6J | Observability and Contract Stress Expansion | `8a1af69` |
| 6I | Timer Producer Queue-Pressure Stress | `e78e503` |
| 6H | ISR/Timer Producer Stress-Lite | `22edfee` |
| 6G | Timer producer smoke (ISR context) | `335ee29` |
| 6F | Devkit Mixed Event Policy Smoke | `5bca62f` |
| 6A–6E | Event pipeline smokes | preceding commits |
| 5F/5F-R | Dispatch split + runtime confirm | `b7f08fe`, `460b9f1` |
| 5E | Critical boundary applied to core queue | `ff24147` |
| 5D | Platform critical section boundary | `4187bb3` |
| 4K | Scheduler admission + throttle policy | preceding commits |

## Next Candidate Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| Phase 7B-1 | Dispatch Budget Test Parameterization (preparation only; no behavior change) | Candidate |
| Phase 6N | Runtime Diagnostic Consolidation / DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md split | Candidate (only if RTT bandwidth or doc navigation cost rises) |
| Phase 7A | Dispatch Budget Evolution Planning | DEFER (no workload-driven reason; Phase 6Z confirms `MAX_EVENTS_PER_TICK=1` is sufficient for current Phase 6I + Phase 6M workload) |
| Custom STM32F407 target | Migration / validation | Pending / Unknown — not exercised by Phase 6Z; remains a separate validation activity |

Dispatch budget remains `ROBOTOS_CORE_MAX_EVENTS_PER_TICK = 1`. Any
mutation requires explicit team decision and a workload-driven
justification beyond what Phase 6Z evidence currently supports.

## GLM Token Optimization Note

GLM token optimization is intentionally excluded until Level 15-17 stabilization is closed. GLM operates under its own policy and is not subject to the delta-command optimizations being applied to Claude Pro and Copilot.

---

## Operating Notes

**Token/context baseline (2026-05-03):** Closed for now; monitor only. Future agents should use `CURRENT_STATE.md` as lightweight startup signal and `PHASE_CLOSE_TEMPLATE.md` as closeout structure to reduce repeated context reconstruction.

**Instruction discipline update:** Copilot/Claude instruction update committed at `6227e17` — *do not reduce validation depth for token savings*. Keep correctness checks even when optimizing context overhead. Caveat: commit `6227e17` included 131 pre-existing lines of GLM Evidence Logging content alongside new material; no revert planned.

**Validation preservation:** Never skip build/test/hardware validation steps to save tokens. Token optimization applies to repo documentation state-tracking, not to correctness gates.

**GLM status:** Excluded from token-shortening until Level 15–17 stabilization closes. GLM operates under separate policy constraints.

---

## Maintenance Rule

- Update this file **only at phase close**, from validated evidence only.
- Do not record assumptions as fact.
- If a fact is unknown, mark it **Pending / Unknown**.
- Detailed history (logs, diffs, RTT evidence) remains in `DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md`.
- This file is the lightweight startup signal; `DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md` is the audit trail.
