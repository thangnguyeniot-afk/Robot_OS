# COMMAND_SET_DRAFT.md — RobotOS Devkit Product Command Vocabulary

**Status at Phase 11C checkpoint (`origin/master = 2aa0435`):**

- **Section A — IMPLEMENTED + hardware-validated:** `a` (0x61), `s`
  (0x73), `r` (0x72), `?` (0x3f), `x` (0x78) (Phase 9E baseline);
  `v` (0x76) per Phase 10B-v
  ([`PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md)); `L` (0x4c) per
  Phase 10B-L ([`PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md)) with
  `OPERATOR_VISUAL_CONFIRMED`; `d` (0x64) per Phase 10B-d
  ([`PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md)).
- **Section B — `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED` (not implemented):** `T`
  (0x54) sensor read; **AND** the ACTIVE disarm widening for `d`
  (currently no-op from ACTIVE; remains
  `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED_ACTIVE_DISARM`).
- **Section C — rejected / deferred shapes:** unchanged from Phase 10A.

This document is the authoritative row table for Section A
implemented commands and Section B `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED`
candidates. It is **not** a specification of behavior beyond the
referenced closeouts; behavior is anchored in the per-phase closeout
docs and the hardware evidence under `../logs/`. **`T` and the ACTIVE
disarm widening are NOT implemented.**

## 1. UART TX Scope Guard (restated, unchanged)

Any command in this document must respect every constraint below. A command
that crosses any row is **not** a Phase 10B-class implementation; it is an
architectural decision that must be raised separately.

| # | Constraint | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No shell / prompt / interactive session semantics | `PHASE_9EZ_CHECKPOINT.md §H` |
| 2 | No parser framework, no token lexer, no grammar | same |
| 3 | No command registry; no dynamic handler registration | same |
| 4 | No multiline / framed protocol; no delimiter framing; no length prefix | same |
| 5 | No heap buffers; all response buffers stack-allocated; fixed size (current 96 B) | same |
| 6 | No response queue; TX is synchronous in the handler | same |
| 7 | No UART logging replacement; RTT remains the canonical log backend | same |
| 8 | No core / platform UART abstraction (`robotos_platform_uart`) | same |
| 9 | No retry / ACK protocol; no sequence number; no error recovery | same |
| 10 | No TX from ISR context; `uart_poll_out()` only from handler | same |
| 11 | No promotion of `devkit_app_state` from devkit-local to Robot Framework | same |
| 12 | Single-byte command vocabulary preserved | implied by 1–4 |

---

## 2. Section A — Hardware-proven Phase 9E commands

These are **already implemented and validated** on hardware. They are
listed here for reference only; Phase 10A does not modify them.

| Byte | Human meaning | Precondition | Side effect | Response template | Phase 9E evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `a` (0x61) | Arm | `IDLE` | `IDLE → ARMED`; `transitions += 1`; `uart += 1` | `OK state=ARMED\r\n` | RTT + host transcript at `587dab7` |
| `s` (0x73) | Start | `ARMED` | `ARMED → ACTIVE`; `transitions += 1`; `uart += 1` | `OK state=ACTIVE\r\n` | same |
| `?` (0x3f) | Query | any | `uart += 1` only | `STATE state=<S> transitions=<N> button=<N> uart=<N> ignored=<N>\r\n` | same |
| `r` (0x72) | Reset to IDLE | any (`ACTIVE → IDLE` proven; `ARMED → IDLE` not explicitly shown in Phase 9E transcript) | `* → IDLE`; `transitions += 1` if state changed; `uart += 1` | `OK state=IDLE\r\n` | same |
| `x` (0x78) | Negative-path probe (unrecognized byte) | any | `uart += 1`; `ignored += 1` | `ERR ignored byte=0x78 state=<S>\r\n` | same |
| `v` (0x76) | Build/version/info query | any | `uart += 1` only (no transition, no ignored) | `INFO phase=10b-v app=devkit board=<CONFIG_BOARD> tick_ms=<DEVKIT_TICK_MS> uart=minimal\r\n` (77 B on `stm32f411e_disco` at `DEVKIT_TICK_MS=500`) | **Phase 10B-v** — hardware-validated 2026-05-11; see [`PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md) and `phase_10B_v_{host,rtt}_2026-05-11.txt`. Promoted from Section B at Phase 10B-v close. |
| `L` (0x4c) | LED physical-effect smoke (single GPIO toggle) | any | `uart += 1` only (no transition, no ignored). Side effect: one `devkit_status_led_toggle()` call from thread-context UART handler. | `OK led=toggle state=<S>\r\n` (26 B) | **Phase 10B-L** — hardware-validated 2026-05-11 (electrical/RTT evidence + `OPERATOR_VISUAL_CONFIRMED` per operator-witnessed re-run); see [`PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md) and `phase_10B_L_{host,rtt}_2026-05-11.txt` plus `phase_10B_L_visual_{host,rtt}_2026-05-11.txt`. Promoted from Section B at Phase 10B-L close. |
| `d` (0x64) | Explicit disarm | `ARMED` (transition); `IDLE` or `ACTIVE` (no-op) | ARMED → IDLE: `transitions += 1`; `uart += 1`. IDLE / ACTIVE: `uart += 1` only (no transition, no ignored). `d` does not replace or alter `r`. | `OK disarm state=IDLE\r\n` (22 B) on ARMED→IDLE; `OK disarm no-op state=<S>\r\n` (28 B IDLE / 30 B ACTIVE) otherwise. | **Phase 10B-d** — hardware-validated 2026-05-11; see [`PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md) and `phase_10B_d_{host,rtt}_2026-05-11.txt`. Promoted from Section B at Phase 10B-d close. ACTIVE disarm remains `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED_ACTIVE_DISARM`; current ACTIVE behavior is a recognized no-op. |

Notes:

- All five commands fit the single-byte / fixed-buffer / no-parser /
  no-registry pattern.
- The `?` query response shape currently exhausts the proven query surface.
  Any extension (e.g. adding fields) is a Phase 10B-class concern, not
  Phase 10A scope.
- The `r` behavior from the `ARMED` precondition is **not surfaced in
  published Phase 9E evidence** (transcript only shows `ACTIVE → IDLE`).
  This is a documentation gap, not a Phase 10A redefinition; if needed it
  must be observed and recorded by a future evidence-only phase, not
  reinterpreted here.

---

## 3. Section B — `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED` (not implemented)

Each row is a **planning artifact only**. No row is approved. No row is
implemented. Opening a Phase 10B-class implementation for any row requires
explicit user approval of that specific row, including answering its
`USER_DECISION_REQUIRED` notes.

Section B at the Phase 11C checkpoint contains:

- **One unimplemented command:** `T` (sensor read, 0x54). Classified
  at Phase 11A as `SENSOR_SURFACE_DECIDED_ADAPTER_PROBE`. Phase 11B
  (`CLOSED_DOCS_ONLY`, 2026-05-12) confirms feasibility via the
  on-board LSM303AGR accelerometer (`lsm303agr_accel` / `lis2dh`
  driver / I2C1) with decision `FEASIBILITY_CONFIRMED_ONBOARD_MEMS`.
  No purchase needed. **Phase 11C (`CLOSED_DOCS_ONLY`, 2026-05-12,
  `PHASE_11C_SPEC_FROZEN_ACCEL_LIS2DH_REV_D`) freezes the probe
  spec**: target = `accel0` → `lsm303agr_accel` on
  `stm32f411e_disco` revision D (operator-confirmed); polling /
  `CONFIG_LIS2DH_TRIGGER_NONE`; channel `SENSOR_CHAN_ACCEL_XYZ` raw
  `val1`/`val2`. Frozen success response:
  `ACC x=<v1>.<v2_6d> y=<v1>.<v2_6d> z=<v1>.<v2_6d>\r\n` (worst case
  68 B; fits 96-byte stack buffer). Frozen error response:
  `ERR accel read=<errno>\r\n` (worst case 28 B). Frozen canonical
  host harness sequence: `T T ?`. The required `prj.conf` additions
  in Phase 11D are `CONFIG_I2C=y` and `CONFIG_SENSOR=y` (Phase 11D
  only; both currently absent from `devkit/prj.conf`); `CONFIG_SPI`,
  `CONFIG_ADC`, `CONFIG_CBPRINTF_FP_SUPPORT` must **not** be added.
  Phase 11D (Implementation) and Phase 11E (Evidence Closeout) are
  conditional and require **explicit user authorization** to open.
  `T` remains `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED` until Phase 11D is
  authorized. See
  [`PHASE_11C_ACCEL_PROBE_SPEC.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_11C_ACCEL_PROBE_SPEC.md)
  §§C–J,
  [`PHASE_11B_DEVICE_DRIVER_FEASIBILITY.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_11B_DEVICE_DRIVER_FEASIBILITY.md)
  §J, and
  [`PHASE_11A_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_SENSOR_SURFACE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_11A_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_SENSOR_SURFACE.md) §F.
- **One unresolved semantic decision** on an already-implemented
  command: ACTIVE disarm widening for `d`. Phase 10B-d implemented `d`
  with ARMED -> IDLE plus IDLE / ACTIVE recognized no-op; whether `d`
  from ACTIVE should *transition* to IDLE is recorded as
  `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED_ACTIVE_DISARM` and tracked in the `d` row of
  Section A and in
  [`PHASE_10C_COMMAND_SET_CHECKPOINT.md §5.1`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10C_COMMAND_SET_CHECKPOINT.md).
  Phase 11A does **not** widen ACTIVE disarm; this is a separate
  small vocabulary housekeeping gate that may be opened only on
  explicit user request, decoupled from the Phase 11A–11E sensor
  track.

The strikethrough rows below are historical records of commands that
were promoted from Section B to Section A as their respective Phase
10B-{v,L,d} closeouts hardware-validated them. They are kept for
traceability and must not be re-edited as if they were live drafts.

| Byte | Human meaning | Precondition | Proposed side effect | Proposed response | Phase 10B? | New driver/config? | Scope-guard violation? | `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED` notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`d` (0x64)~~ | **PROMOTED to Section A** — implemented at Phase 10B-d, 2026-05-11 | — | — | `OK disarm state=IDLE\r\n` (ARMED → IDLE) / `OK disarm no-op state=<S>\r\n` (IDLE or ACTIVE) | **DONE** | No | No | See [`PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md). `d` from ARMED transitions to IDLE; `d` from IDLE is a recognized no-op (not ignored — distinct from `r`); `d` from ACTIVE remains `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED_ACTIVE_DISARM` and is treated as a recognized no-op for now. `r` is preserved zero-diff and remains the canonical reset path. |
| ~~`v` (0x76)~~ | **PROMOTED to Section A** — implemented at Phase 10B-v, 2026-05-11 | — | — | `INFO phase=10b-v app=devkit board=<CONFIG_BOARD> tick_ms=<DEVKIT_TICK_MS> uart=minimal\r\n` | **DONE** | No | No | See [`PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md). Phase tag `10b-v` is the closeout identifier; the response format may be reviewed in a future planning phase but is **frozen** as published baseline. |
| ~~`L` (0x4c)~~ | **PROMOTED to Section A** — implemented at Phase 10B-L, 2026-05-11 | — | — | `OK led=toggle state=<S>\r\n` | **DONE** | No (existing `devkit_status_led_toggle()` API reused; no new LED function) | No | See [`PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md). Physical effect: single GPIO toggle interleaved with the existing 500 ms heartbeat. LED state is **not** exposed in `?` (existing toggle is stateless). Visual LED observation is `PHYSICAL_OBSERVATION_AMBIGUOUS` pending operator-witnessed re-run. |
| `T` (0x54) | DRAFT — Sensor read (decision gate / step-up candidate, NOT product semantics) | any | Driver-dependent read; no actuator change | **Frozen at Phase 11C:** Success `ACC x=<v1>.<v2_6d> y=<v1>.<v2_6d> z=<v1>.<v2_6d>\r\n` (worst case 68 B); error `ERR accel read=<errno>\r\n` (worst case 28 B); raw `sensor_value.val1`/`val2`, six-digit absolute fractional part, sign carried by `val1`; no floating point. | **Not implemented;** classified at Phase 11A as `SENSOR_SURFACE_DECIDED_ADAPTER_PROBE`. Phase 11B (`CLOSED_DOCS_ONLY`) confirms `FEASIBILITY_CONFIRMED_ONBOARD_MEMS`: `lsm303agr_accel` / `lis2dh` driver / I2C1; no purchase. **Phase 11C (`CLOSED_DOCS_ONLY`, 2026-05-12) freezes the probe spec** for revision D / `accel0` / polling / `SENSOR_CHAN_ACCEL_XYZ`. Phase 11D (firmware) requires explicit user authorization. | **Phase 11D must add:** `CONFIG_I2C=y` + `CONFIG_SENSOR=y` (both currently absent from `devkit/prj.conf`). **Phase 11D must NOT add:** `CONFIG_SPI`, `CONFIG_ADC`, `CONFIG_CBPRINTF_FP_SUPPORT`, `CONFIG_LIS2DH_*` range/ODR overrides. Optional `CONFIG_LIS2DH_TRIGGER_NONE=y` only if pristine `.config` does not already set it. No overlay. **Phase 11D NOT authorized by Phase 11C — user must explicitly approve.** | No — frozen at Phase 11C to fit 96-byte stack buffer with margin (worst case 68 B success / 28 B error). | **`USER_DECISION_REQUIRED`** pending **Phase 11D authorization** (Phase 11C spec is frozen). Phase 11C spec: [`PHASE_11C_ACCEL_PROBE_SPEC.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_11C_ACCEL_PROBE_SPEC.md) §§C–J. Phase 11B feasibility: [`PHASE_11B_DEVICE_DRIVER_FEASIBILITY.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_11B_DEVICE_DRIVER_FEASIBILITY.md) §J. Phase 11A classification: [`PHASE_11A_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_SENSOR_SURFACE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_11A_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_SENSOR_SURFACE.md) §F. `T` is **not** a mistake; spec is frozen, only implementation authorization remains. |

DRAFT rows that were considered and intentionally **omitted** from
Section B because they do not align cleanly with the existing model:

- `n` / `S` (heartbeat) — provides no information beyond the existing
  Phase 6M producer telemetry visible on RTT; no product value at this
  layer.
- `H` (halt) — implies a stop semantic that the existing IDLE/ARMED/ACTIVE
  model does not represent. Out of scope for Phase 10A.

---

## 4. Section C — Explicitly rejected / deferred command shapes

The following shapes are **rejected at Phase 10A**. Each crosses one or more
UART TX scope-guard constraints from §1. None should be implemented under a
Phase 10B-class umbrella; each requires its own architectural decision.

| Shape | Constraint(s) crossed | Why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-byte tokens (e.g. `ARM\r\n`, `STATUS\r\n`, `LED ON\r\n`) | #1, #2, #4, #12 | Requires shell/parser/framing. |
| Commands with arguments (e.g. `s 0.5`, `T sensor=core`) | #2, #4 | Requires parser + bounded argument lexer. |
| ACK/NACK + sequence numbers (e.g. `OK seq=42\r\n`) | #9 | Introduces a sequencing protocol; cascades into retry semantics. |
| Streaming/periodic telemetry over UART (e.g. emit `STATE …` every N ticks) | #7 | Replaces RTT as the canonical log backend; introduces TX cadence outside command/response. |
| Dynamic per-session command registration | #3 | Requires command registry. |
| Response longer than the current 96-byte fixed buffer | #5, #6 | Requires heap or response queue. |
| Commands that read or mutate `core/` or `platform/` internals | architectural | Breaks the 9A–9E invariant that `core/` / `platform/` are untouched. |
| Commands that originate TX from ISR context | #10 | TX must be thread-context only. |
| Authentication / authorization commands | architectural | Security design is not in any current phase scope. |
| Fault-injection or fault-recovery commands | architectural | Fault-recovery is not in any current phase scope. |

## 5. Implementation candidates that may become Phase 10B (when approved)

Each candidate below is a **non-binding ordering suggestion** for future
Phase 10B-class implementation. Order is not fixed by Phase 10A. Each
candidate, when opened, must follow the Phase 9E-style validation
discipline: pristine build, flash via `capture_devkit_rtt.ps1` (manual RESET
retained as fallback; plain `west flash` alone is not runtime-start
evidence), RTT counter table, host transcript table, architecture-boundary
preservation audit, scope-guard restated, and a dedicated closeout document.

1. ~~**Phase 10B-`v` (build query)**~~ — **IMPLEMENTED 2026-05-11**;
   see [`PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_V_CLOSE.md). Hardware-validated
   on STM32F411E-DISCO; 77-byte fixed response; no parser/registry; no
   driver dependency; no state-change side effect; `ignored` does not
   increment.
2. ~~**Phase 10B-`L` (LED toggle)**~~ — **IMPLEMENTED 2026-05-11**;
   see [`PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_L_CLOSE.md). Hardware-validated
   electrical/RTT evidence on STM32F411E-DISCO + `OPERATOR_VISUAL_CONFIRMED`
   per operator-witnessed re-run; 26-byte fixed response; existing
   `devkit_status_led_toggle()` reused (no new LED API); heartbeat
   semantics preserved.
3. ~~**Phase 10B-`d` (explicit disarm)**~~ — **IMPLEMENTED 2026-05-11**;
   see [`PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md`](../02_PHASE_CLOSEOUTS/PHASE_10B_D_CLOSE.md). Hardware-validated
   on STM32F411E-DISCO; 22-byte (transition) / 28-30-byte (no-op) fixed
   response; no parser/registry; no driver dependency. ARMED → IDLE
   transition; IDLE no-op (recognized, not ignored — distinct from `r`).
   ACTIVE disarm remains `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED_ACTIVE_DISARM` (current
   behavior: recognized no-op).
4. **Phase 10B-`T` (sensor read)** — largest remaining surface; introduces
   a driver dependency and a numeric response format; requires choosing a
   sensor part.

Direction-independent supporting phases that the user may prefer to land
**before** any Phase 10B opening:

- **Phase 9F — Demo script PASS/FAIL polish.** Tooling only; no firmware
  change. Adds substring-assertion checking to
  `run_phase9e_uart_response_demo.ps1`.
- **Phase 9G — Bounded UART burst characterization.** Evidence-only;
  no firmware change. Closes the highest-priority outstanding unknown
  (high-rate UART input) and informs any future scheduler discussion.

Neither 9F nor 9G consumes the Phase 10 opening.

---

## 6. Operational reminders carried forward from Phase 9E-Z

- `core/` and `platform/` remain untouched through Phase 9A–9E. No Phase
  10B-class implementation may regress this without a written justification
  anchored in evidence.
- Scheduler 7A / 7B-1 remains DEFER. Phase 9E `peak=2 dropped=0` and
  Phase 9D operator-induced `peak=16 dropped=3 herr=0` do not justify
  budget mutation.
- Phase 8A / F407 remains HOLD/DEFER.
- POST_FLASH_AUTOSTART root cause remains OPEN; mitigated-by-workflow from
  Phase 6O onward via `capture_devkit_rtt.ps1` sidecar `reset run`; manual
  RESET retained as fallback; plain `west flash` alone is not runtime-start
  evidence.
- RTT remains the canonical log backend; UART is not a log channel.
- `uart_poll_out()` runs only from handler (thread context).

---

## 7. What this document does not do

- Does not specify behavior. Section B rows are draft, not specification.
- Does not commit to any command. Section B rows are user-approval-gated.
- Does not authorize any source/test/CMake/Zephyr/board/script change.
- Does not start Phase 10B.
- Does not change Phase 9E / 9E-Z baseline.
- Does not modify `DEVKIT_PROGRESS.md`, scheduler state, F407 state, or UART
  TX scope.
